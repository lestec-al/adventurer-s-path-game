# RPG-like Game with Python and PyGame

The project on early stage of development, but game may be improved. Demo is playable, but game world is very small.

What is ready (but could be improved):
- player/NPC with animations, battle logic, skills (spear, sword), inventory, health, energy
- some items (weapons, clothes, potions), chests
- player keyboard controls (wasd - move, f - attack, i - inventory and stats)
- basic UI
- basic sounds
- test world map with example NPC
- NPC move (with colisions(not ideal), when player in some radius) and attack the player

Work in process:
- optimization (fast, stable gameplay, code organize) ?
- better battle logic (step back in battle) ?
- improve sounds

In future (maybe):
- main menu, saves
- simple story, normal world map (many NPCs, items(icons))

You need:
- install Python (v3.10 or higher)
- install PyGame, Pillow
- download (and extract) or clone this repo
- launch via command line "python main.py" in the project folder
