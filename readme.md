# RPG-like Game with Python and PyGame

The project on early stage of development, but game may be improved. Demo is playable, but game world is very small.

What is ready (but could be improved):
- player/NPC with animations, battle logic, skills (staff, sword), inventory, health, energy
- items (weapons, clothes, potions), chests
- player keyboard controls (wasd - move, f - attack, i - inventory and stats)
- basic UI
- test world map with example NPC
- NPC move (with colisions(not ideal), when player in some radius) and attack the player

Work in process:
- optimization (fast, stable gameplay, code organize)
- items icons
- better battle logic (step back in battle, player under attack) ?

In future (maybe):
- main menu, saves
- simple story, big world map (many NPCs, items)

You need:
- install Python (v3.10 or higher)
- install PyGame, Pillow
- download (and extract) or clone this repo
- launch via command line "python main.py" in the project folder
