# RPG-like Game with Python and PyGame

Game on early stage of development. Ready basic mechanics (player, NPCs, items), but game world work in process.

Work in process:
- main menu screen, saves
- story, proper world map (Graphics: trees, grass, sea, objects. NPCs, items)
- optimization (fast, stable gameplay)
- NPCs movement
- better battle logic (step back in battle)

What is ready (but could be improved):
- player (NPC) with animations, battle logic, skills, inventory (for items: weapons, clothes, health potions)
- player keyboard controls (wasd - move, f - attack, i - inventory and stats)
- basic interface for player stats, inventory
- test world map with example NPC

You need:
- install Python (v3.10 or higher)
- install PyGame, Pillow
